# IPFS and Fleek

## Overview

## IPFS

### Setting up IPFS

After pulling and running the [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs/), we can check on the container to make sure its working:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                                                                                                                                                 NAMES

### Working with IPFS

After gaining access to the IPFS UI, I uploaded a file by going to files > import > file.

![Uploaded file](images/UploadedFile.png)

**The CID for the file:** `Qmd2wQSRAaHRHNxNSzQnB5gMEBHKWkiwKEJE8JiPHMaYPM`

I copied the `CID` hash so I can use it to access my file through an [IPFS Public Gateway](https://ipfs.io/ipfs) following the [documentation](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#cid)

The IPFS UI provide us with information about the network we are are in, like the number of peers that are connected to the network, where they're from, their ID, and their connection type and latency.

We can also observe the network traffic and bandwidth over time of our machine.

## Fleek

For deployment on Fleek I used the HTML page `index.html` in the `lab16` folder.

I followed the [documentation](https://fleek.xyz/docs/platform/hosting/) to deploy the app.

- **Deployment Check:**
